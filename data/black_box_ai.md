# The Myth of the 'Black Box' AI

Artificial intelligence has been around for a long time, but recently it has become the buzzword for startups looking to get venture capital or news sites looking for the next boogieman. In the ever growing conversation around AI there always comes a point where someone will explain new forms of artificial intelligence as a 'Black Box', this is possibly the most egregious form of conceptualizing artificial intelligence I can think of and in this post I hope to explain why.

For those of you who do not know me, I am a software developer working in the aerospace industry and a co-founder of [BitSurf](https://bitsurf.network).  I have many interest in tech, and science in general,  but I have always been fascinated with artificial intelligence. I remember the first time I really thought about the idea of computers being able to make decisions was playing Halo when I was younger and thinking about the ways they could have programmed the enemies in the campaign to act they way they did. My main interests in AI now are how it can be used in novel applications like manufacturing, agriculture, scientific research, social media, and space exploration.

## What is AI?

This may seem like a straight forward question, but the conversation in pop-culture around AI has really skewed peoples perceptions of what artificial intelligence really is and what it is not. To make it simple, AI is when computers make decisions. It does not mean that there is some amazingly complex, unfathomable function making these decision, in fact in most cases it is quite the opposite.

If you looked at commercial applications of artificial intelligence you would see that up until recently most "artificial intelligence" was just decision trees, which basically amount to a bunch of "if this then that" statements. Only very recently did we have the computational power to do any other form of artificial intelligence cost effectively.

The main type of artificial intelligence in use today (besides the basic ones like decision trees that have been around for years and still dominate the commercial space) is something called deep learning (a subset of machine learning), which comes in many different forms for many different applications. *(Note: In the coming days I will be doing technical articles on some various types of Deep Learning algorithms.)* Even though they come in many different forms, all deep learning is based on the same principle. That being the idea of using data to train something called a neural network (often referred to as a model) to perform a specific task, this involves feeding the model data that it would see in the real application and having it produce an output of interest and comparing it to the desired output, then correcting the model. If you do this long enough and with the correct type of neural network you might create something that can make decisions for the very narrow task you trained it on.

## Why the 'Black Box' is wrong

It is quite easy for people to understand decision trees and hardly anyone would describe this form of decision making as artificial intelligence, but it is. The problem with deep learning and neural networks is that they are not easy to understand, and are based on linear algebra and calculus so explaining them requires quite a bit of prerequisite knowledge on the part of the audience. This leads people to misrepresent AI as a black box, because they do not want to either bore their audience or make the subject so complicated that it is impossible to have a meaningful conversation about, and while the later is a great reason to not get too technical it is not a good reason to completely misconstrue something as mystical or unintelligible when it is, in fact, just complicated.

So then why exactly is artificial intelligence not a 'black box'? Well the answer is simple. Math. Neural networks, and any other form of artificial intelligence, are a purely mathematical concoction and can be expressed as a mathematical function. This is also true for what is happening during deep learning, which is the process of training a neural network. There is no magic, only math, and every step can be described perfectly by the mathematics, and it is beautiful.
